 ## Getting Started

To clone this repository along with all submodules, run:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/rguntz/ibrl-docker.git

```

Download data and BC models


Download dataset and models from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F2yH84Iqv0qRPmfH8o-kSzgtfaoqMzWE/view?usp=sharing) and put the folders under `release` folder.
The release folder should contain `release/cfgs` (already shipped with the repo), `release/data` and `release/model` (the latter two are from the downloaded zip file).
