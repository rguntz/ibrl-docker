  //   for example, set_joint_inputs --nothing-in-between--> receive_robot_output
  // - the other thread has priority to run after the current thread finishes
  //
  // Mutex ownership
  //
  // call mutex_preempt_ 1 and mutex_data_ 2 for simplicity
  // daemon: |-|-1-|-12-|-2-|--------|-1-|-12-|-2-|-|
  // main:   |------------|-1-|-12-|-2-|------------|
  //
  // Exception handling
  //
  // - if an exception is thrown in the main thread
  //   - the daemon thread gets std::terminate
  //   - the main thread unwind the stack: ~TrossenArmDriver() -> cleanup()
  // - if an exception is thrown in the daemon thread
  //   - the exception is stored in exception_ptr_
  //   - the daemon thread returns
  //   - the main thread gets the exception and rethrows it at the next operation
  //   - the main thread unwind the stack: ~TrossenArmDriver() -> cleanup()
  //
  // Notes
  //
  // - the mutex claiming cannot be nested or there will be deadlocks, i.e., |-1-|-12-|-2-|-12-|-2-|
  //   is not allowed
  // - when an exception is thrown by the main thread, the program is expected to terminate either
  //   immediately or right after cleaning up the resources not related to the driver
