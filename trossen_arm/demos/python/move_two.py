# Purpose:
# This script demonstrates how to move two robots to different positions using interpolation.

# Hardware setup:
# 1. A WXAI V0 arm with leader end effector and ip at 192.168.1.2
# 2. A WXAI V0 arm with follower end effector and ip at 192.168.1.3

# The script does the following:
# 1. Initializes the drivers
# 2. Configures the drivers with the leader and follower configurations
# 3. Sets the robots to position mode
# 4. Records the sleep positions
# 5. Generates trajectories: sleep -> sleep -> home -> home -> sleep -> sleep
# 6. Moves the robots along the trajectories
# 7. Sets the robots to the idle mode
# 8. The driver automatically sets the mode to idle at the destructor
